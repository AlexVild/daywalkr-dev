## Taking a Break from Middle Ages: Online

![The kind of event that drains me to work on... look at all these silly conditions! This one's been around a while.](/posts/9.18.2025/editor_work.png)

I have been super burnt out working on MA:O these past few months. In life, I have taken up some new hobbies as well as just taking more time to dive deeper into other things I want to do. Beyond the fun stuff, I have also been extra busy at work, and as most of you know game dev is not my full-time job (in fact, it just costs me money lol).

SO, I'm takin' a whee little break. I'm going to do some different game dev work -- likely, I will be transitioning to a small idea in Godot I've had for a while.

The problem is I just feel BAD about this... I don't want to throw in the towel on something I've been working on for over 4 years, and I feel bad to those (albeit, the few) that have spent a LOT of time in my game. I do _want_ to "complete" MA:O; to finish the main story and get the game on steam has been a goal of mine all this time, and continues to be. But I just feel like I don't have that dog in me right now.

Who knows, though. This kinda thing has happened before, and like two weeks later I was back in MA:O-land, lol.
